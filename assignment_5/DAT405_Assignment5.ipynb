Assume now that given a certain state $s$ and action $a$, there is a probability of 0.8 that that action will be performed and a probability of 0.2 that no action is taken. For instance, if we take action **E** in state $(x,y)$ we will go to $(x+1,y)$ 80 percent of the time (given that that action is available in that state, that is, we stay on the grid), and remain still 20 percent of the time. We will use have a discount factor $\\gamma = 0.9$. Let the initial value be $V^0(s)=0$ for all states $s\\in S$. \r\n",

        "Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning mainly in that it learns from its environment and not from a set of predefined labeled or unlabeled data. This puts reinforcement learning in the class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. However, it still differs from other types of unsupervised learning such as clustering in that it learns on its own through a method of trial and error and feedback from the environment. One big advantage of this, comparing it to supervised learning, is that it does not need huge amounts of data in order to train the system for arriving at a generalized formula. Instead, the learning agent creates data on its own to by interacting with the environment.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "More generally, reinforcement learning focuses on **sequential decision making** where, given the current input from the environment, the agent makes a decision, and the next input depends on that decision. In supervised learning, such as regression and classification, the decisions are independent of each other.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Another notable difference between the two classes is that reinforcement learning does not require as much involvement of its teacher. In some sense, one might claim it's more independent than supervised learning models. The motivation behind this is that supervised learning requires more work by its designer in the training process, since it requires large amount of processed data, and further needs to be tweaked and evaluated iteratively. Supervised learning essentially answers the question *\"I know how to classify this data, I just need you (the model) to do this task\"*. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, only really needs the teacher to reward or punish the model based on its output for it to learn. Hence, it answers the question *\"I don't know how to ACT in this environment, can you find a good policy/behavior and meanwhile I'll give you feedback\"*\r\n"
