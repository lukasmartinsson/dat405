b)

The scatterplots indicate that there is some correlation 
between life expectancy and GDP per capita. This is futher supported 
when the scatterplot is using a log-scale on GDP and thus shows a linear
curv. Therefore it would not be controversial to assume that a higher GDP
leads to a higher life expectancy and vise versa. However as the log-scale
demonstrates there are more factors than GDP when it comes to predicting
life expectancy. Amoung them could be cultural and social aspects in each
country with might lead to higher life satisfaction which potentially could
increase life expectancy. However one could also argue that the culture
itself could be a reason for a higher GDP. Hence the only conclusion to
be drawn is that GDP have a strong correlation with Life expectancy
